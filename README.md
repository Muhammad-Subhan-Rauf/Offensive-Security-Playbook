# Advanced Offensive Security & Mobile Exploitation Project

This repository contains the source code for a multi-stage cybersecurity project completed for the CSCS 495 Cyber Security course. The project demonstrates a full attack chain, from initial network intrusion via Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attacks to client-side exploitation and payload delivery on an Android device.

---

## ‚õìÔ∏è Attack Chain Overview

The project simulates a real-world attack scenario where an attacker on a local network gains control over a victim's traffic and uses that position to compromise their devices.

1.  **Gain Network Control (MitM):** The attacker first performs an **ARP Spoofing** attack to poison the ARP cache of the victim machine and the network gateway. This forces all of the victim's traffic to pass through the attacker's machine.

2.  **Redirect Maliciously (DNS Spoofing):** With traffic redirected, the attacker runs a **DNS Spoofer**. When the victim tries to access a specific website (e.g., `vulnweb.com`), the spoofer intercepts the DNS query and responds with the IP address of the attacker's own web server, leading the victim to a malicious page.

3.  **Compromise Mobile Device (APK Trojanizing):** The project demonstrates how to create a native reverse shell payload using the **Android NDK**. This C-based binary is then injected into a legitimate Android application (APK). The APK is decompiled, the payload and execution code (in Smali) are added, and the application is recompiled and signed, turning it into a trojan. When the unsuspecting user runs the app, it executes the payload, giving the attacker a reverse shell.

4.  **Client-Side Exploitation (Browser Hooking - Optional Task):** As an extension, the project includes a `mitmproxy` script to inject a **BeEF (Browser Exploitation Framework)** hook into any unencrypted HTTP web page the victim visits. This effectively hijacks the victim's browser, allowing for further client-side attacks.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Core Components & Scripts

This repository includes the following key scripts:

#### `arpspoofer2.py`
*   **Purpose:** Establishes the Man-in-the-Middle position.
*   **Functionality:**
    *   Identifies the MAC addresses of the victim and the gateway.
    *   Sends crafted ARP packets to the victim, telling it the attacker's MAC address belongs to the gateway.
    *   Sends crafted ARP packets to the gateway, telling it the attacker's MAC address belongs to the victim.
    *   Includes a `finally` block to automatically restore the network's ARP tables upon exit (`Ctrl+C`), preventing permanent network disruption.

#### `dnsspoofer2.py`
*   **Purpose:** To perform DNS hijacking once MitM is active.
*   **Functionality:**
    *   Uses `scapy.sniff` with a BPF filter to efficiently capture DNS queries (UDP port 53) from the victim.
    *   Checks if the queried domain is on a target list.
    *   If a match is found, it crafts a fake DNS response packet, mapping the domain to the attacker's IP address.
    *   Sends the spoofed response directly to the victim, racing against the real DNS server's response.

#### Android Reverse Shell (`revshell.c` - *not provided, but created as part of the project*)
*   **Purpose:** The native payload to be executed on the Android device.
*   **Functionality:**
    *   A standard C program that opens a socket connection back to the attacker's IP and port.
    *   Duplicates the `stdin`, `stdout`, and `stderr` file descriptors to the socket, effectively spawning `/bin/sh` and giving the attacker a remote shell.
    *   Compiled using the Android NDK for the target architecture (e.g., `x86` for an emulator).

#### `SplashScreen.smali.txt` (Payload Dropper & Executor)
*   **Purpose:** The injected code that runs the native payload.
*   **Functionality:**
    *   This is Smali assembly code injected into a decompiled APK's `onCreate` method.
    *   It copies the native `revshell` binary from the APK's `assets` folder to the app's private, executable data directory.
    *   It changes the file permissions to make the binary executable (`setExecutable(true)`).
    *   It uses `Runtime.getRuntime().exec()` to execute the binary, triggering the reverse shell.

#### `beef_injector.py` (Optional Task)
*   **Purpose:** To hook browsers using the BeEF framework.
*   **Functionality:**
    *   A `mitmproxy` addon script.
    *   Intercepts all HTTP responses.
    *   If a response is of type `text/html`, it injects the BeEF `hook.js` script tag just before the `</head>` or `</body>` tag.
    *   This hooks the victim's browser to the attacker-controlled BeEF panel.

## üöÄ Execution Guide

### Prerequisites
*   A Linux environment (Kali Linux recommended).
*   Python 3 and required libraries: `pip install scapy mitmproxy`
*   Android NDK installed and configured.
*   An Android emulator (Genymotion recommended).
*   A benign target APK for trojanizing.
*   `apktool` for decompiling/recompiling the APK.

### Task 1: MitM Attack & DNS Spoofing

1.  **Configure Scripts:** Update the IP addresses in `dnsspoofer2.py` and `arpspoofer2.py` to match your network setup (Kali IP, Victim IP, Gateway IP).
2.  **Enable IP Forwarding:** On the attacker machine, enable packet forwarding to allow victim traffic to pass through to the internet.
    ```bash
    sudo sysctl -w net.ipv4.ip_forward=1
    ```
3.  **Start Web Server:** Host a fake website on the attacker machine.
    ```bash
    sudo systemctl start apache2
    # Place your index.html in /var/www/html/
    ```
4.  **Launch Attacks:** Open two separate terminals on the attacker machine.
    *   **Terminal 1 (ARP Spoofer):**
        ```bash
        sudo python3 arpspoofer2.py
        ```
    *   **Terminal 2 (DNS Spoofer):**
        ```bash
        sudo python3 dnsspoofer2.py
        ```
5.  **Test:** On the victim machine, try to access `http://vulnweb.com` or `http://example.com`. You should be served the page from your attacker's web server.

### Task 2: Android APK Trojanizing

1.  **Create Payload:** Write and compile your `revshell.c` using the Android NDK.
    ```bash
    # (Inside your NDK project directory)
    $NDK_HOME/ndk-build
    ```
    This will create the `revshell` binary in the `libs/<architecture>/` directory.
2.  **Decompile APK:**
    ```bash
    apktool d original_app.apk -o decompiled_app
    ```
3.  **Inject Payload:**
    *   Copy the compiled `revshell` binary into the `decompiled_app/assets/` directory.
    *   Open the target Smali file (e.g., `decompiled_app/smali/com/dotgears/flappy/SplashScreen.smali`).
    *   Carefully insert the code from `SplashScreen.smali.txt` into the `onCreate` method.
4.  **Recompile & Sign:**
    ```bash
    # Recompile
    apktool b decompiled_app -o trojan_app.apk

    # Sign the APK (requires a keystore)
    jarsigner -verbose -sigalg SHA1withRSA -digestalg SHA1 -keystore my-release-key.keystore trojan_app.apk alias_name
    ```
5.  **Execute:**
    *   Start a `netcat` listener on the attacker machine: `nc -lvnp 5555`.
    *   Install and run `trojan_app.apk` on the Android emulator.
    *   Check your `netcat` listener for an incoming reverse shell connection.
